____
When we construct new literal expressions with const assertions, we can signal to the language that

* no literal types in that expression should be widened (e.g. no going from "hello" to string)
* object literals get readonly properties
* array literals become readonly tuples

```typescript
// Type '"hello"'
let x = "hello" as const;

// Type 'readonly [10, 20]'
let y = [10, 20] as const;

// Type '{ readonly text: "hello" }'
let z = { text: "hello" } as const;
```

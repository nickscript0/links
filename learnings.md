- Parable of the broken window: ["The parable seeks to show how opportunity costs, as well as the law of unintended consequences, affect economic activity in ways that are unseen or ignored. The belief that destruction is good for the economy is consequently known as the broken window fallacy or glazier's fallacy."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window)
  - [From this good twitter discussion on fallacies: Reread “Economics in One Lesson” last night so I’m biased since it’s fresh on my mind, but it’s amazing how prevalent the Broken Window Fallacy is.](https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1254387759638183936?s=20)

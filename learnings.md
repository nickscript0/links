- [Parable of the broken window: "The parable seeks to show how opportunity costs, as well as the law of unintended consequences, affect economic activity in ways that are unseen or ignored. The belief that destruction is good for the economy is consequently known as the broken window fallacy or glazier's fallacy."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window)
